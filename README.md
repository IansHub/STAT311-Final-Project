This repository contains the data in xlsx form collected from a bank. It contains data on 7,420 customers with variables for revenue, account balance, customer age, account age, and the account types a customer may have.

All findings are documented in the Final Project word doc which is a report on my hypotheses, results and conclusions. 

A powerpoint presentation has been included as well for a more brief overview of the project.
